My name is Will, I&amp;rsquo;m a backend software engineer based near Bristol in the UK. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer within the Civil Service, having interned here in 2016 and started full time in 2017. In 2017 I also received my computer science degree with first class honours from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK.
While at work, I build exciting new systems while maintaining and improving legacy ones.</description></item></channel></rss>
