      <description>Hey everyone! My name is Will and I&amp;rsquo;m an engineer based near Bristol, in the UK.
The reason I started this space was to write about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing and am currently doing in work and in my spare time. The goal is to show my thoughts/thinking on what I get up to, and provide advice where appropriate for people who want to start long and happy careers in technology.</description>
