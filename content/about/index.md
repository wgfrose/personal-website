Hello there! My name is Will, I'm a backend software engineer based near Bristol in the UK. Currently, I'm an engineer within the Civil Service, having interned here in 2016 and started full time in 2017. In 2017 I also received my computer science degree with first class honours from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK.

I'm also currently looking for a new role that is both challenging and rewarding, within a great team of enthusiastic and passionate individuals!

While at work, I design and build big data storage, query and analytics platforms in the Civil Service to support technical analysts, as well as maintain and improve legacy systems. The main technologies I work with/have experience in are as follows (but this is by no means a definitive list, I'm always looking to learn new skills and technologies!):

- Java/SpringBoot
- Python
- Elasticsearch/MongoDB
- Docker/Kubernetes
- AWS

A lot of my work is based in the UK, but a fair share involves a lot of collaboration with our international partners, so being able to maintain working relationships is also key.

During my volunteering time at work however, (in pre-COVID times), I was a recruitment ambassador at various STEM fairs at universities across the country. Also I helped teach an afterschool code club at the local primary schools. In my free time, I read lots of books, build mechanical keyboards from scratch and mess around with music synthesis.

I've been a self-starter in tech since 2012, when I setup an iPhone app club at my secondary school, wanting to learn more about it. If you need a mentor or an organisation ambassador, I'll probably do it! Feel free to email me so we can chat!

Thanks for reading ☺️
