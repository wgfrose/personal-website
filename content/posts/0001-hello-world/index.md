Hey everyone! My name is Will and I'm an engineer based near Bristol, in the UK. 

The reason I started this space was to write about what I've been doing and am currently doing in work and in my spare time. The goal is to show my thoughts/thinking on what I get up to, and provide advice where appropriate for people who want to start long and happy careers in technology.

Blogging is entirely new to me, so be kind, but now I bought this domain I may as well do something with it right?

Will
